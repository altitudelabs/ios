Hello!

Thanks for your interest in Altitude Labs.

Here's a short exercise for us to get a sense of how you would go about coding in your day-to-day job. We are looking for more than just working code. We are looking for well-written code, good structure and an understanding of how to test your code. You are free to use Google and the internet and encouraged to ask questons if you get stuck or have any questions.

When you're done, submit a pull request to this repository.

#### Exercise

* Create an app that initially displays a form with controls to enter a username and password and a button to submit the form (see mockup below). When the form is submitted, check that (1) username is at least 8 characters in length and alphabetic and (2) password is at least 8 characters in length
* If the info in the form is valid, navigate to another page and display an image and a button. The button when pressed will return to the previous screen. The image when tapped should show a message saying "Hello World"
* If the user returns to the previous screen all information in the form should be cleared
